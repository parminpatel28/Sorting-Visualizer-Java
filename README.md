# Sorting-Visualizer-Java


WHY

I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.

HOW

Every time the program starts a new set of an array is generated in random order.
The goal is to sort the array in ascending order using one of the sorting algorithms. 
3 algorithms will be randomly chosen by the compiler which will be utilized for sorting the array.
